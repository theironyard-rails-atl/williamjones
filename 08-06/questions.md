# ## 1. Data, data, data
#
# Take a look at the included `widgets.yml` file. Write a Ruby
# script to find
#
# * The most and least expensive widget
# * The total revenue and profit from all widgets sold
# * The top 10 best selling widgets
# * The number of widgets sold in each department (# This is hardest one)
#
#
# ## 2. Would You Like to Play a Game?
#
# Using all your Ruby object prowess, design a playable game.
# You should use at least 4 classes, at least 2 of which are
# subclasses of a single parent.
#
# Ideas:
#
# * Adapt liberally from the rougelike presented in class
# * Design a racing game, with different classes of cars that
#   have different speeds and abilities

# after speaking with James use enumerals on arrays and hases
# instead of creating clases with the homework

=========

# for total revenue 'reduce' & 'reject' both could be used.
